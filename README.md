# Data Curation and Analysis 
The goal of this project is to collect and extract data from a dataset and then create a graph with it. The data I collected are from a wikipedia page of list of countrie by population


Data types: Integers, floats, string, date.

Attributes: Country: The name of the country or dependent territory, Population: The total population of the country. Percent of World (Float): The percentage of the world population represented by the country. Date (Date): The date associated with the dataset, indicating when the data was collected or relevant.


When starting this coding project, I had to find a source that I wanted to scrape from and then check if  BeautifulSoup and Pandas were installed. Afterward, I had to add codes that perform web scraping in order to access and analyze the content of the dataset (IMDB Top 1000). The codes will then read the CSV files and summarize the information about the dataset in the data frame. Then I created a bar graph that displays how movie ratings are distributed across various genres, showing the difference between the various genres. 
The platform I got this dataset from is a popular platform used for users to rate and review movies and TV shows. Therefore, these datasets are based on opinions, so they could be biased by potential manipulation or biases in user reviews.
