# Data Curation and Analysis 
Objective: Collect and extract data from a dataset and then create a graph with it.

The goal of this project is to curate a dataset from the Wikipedia page "List of countries by population" and analyze it in order to gain insights. Web scraping techniques using BeautifulSoup within Google Colab are part of the data collection strategy. I extract the relevant information from the Wikipedia page by obtaining the HTML content, and the HTML table is then transformed into a Pandas DataFrame.  I examine the processed data and generate statistics and visualizations to provide insight into the dataset. The project's focus is on the dataset's reliability and relevance. Accuracy and representativeness are important because they ensure that the dataset accurately reflects the population being studied. In addition, I provide the code used in Google Colab, as well as the raw and processed datasets saved as CSV files. Overall, this project reflects the data collection and analysis process.
