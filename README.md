# Coding-Assignment-
The goal of this project is to collect and extract data from a dataset and then create a graph with it. 
The data I collected includes IMDB top 1,000 movies of all time with attributes such as Title, Certificate, Duration, Genre, etc.

When starting this coding project, I had to find a source that I wanted to scrape from and then check if  BeautifulSoup and Pandas were installed. Afterward, I had to add codes that perform web scraping in order to access and analyze the content of the dataset (IMDB Top 1000). The codes will then read the CSV files and summarize the information about the dataset in the data frame. Then I created a bar graph that displays how movie ratings are distributed across various genres, showing the difference between the various genres. 
The platform I got this dataset from is a popular platform used for users to rate and review movies and TV shows. Therefore, these datasets are based on opinions, so they could be biased by potential manipulation or biases in user reviews.
