"This is a list of countries and"
"dependencies by population. It"
"includes     sovereign     states,"
"inhabited dependent territories"
"and, in some cases, constituent"
"countries of sovereign states,"
"with inclusion within the list"
"being primarily based on the"
"ISO standard ISO 3166-1. For"
"instance, the United Kingdom is"
"Cartogram of the world's population in 2018; each square represents"
"considered a single entity, while"
"500,000 people."
"the constituent countries of the"
"Kingdom of the Netherlands are"
"considered separately. In addition, this list includes certain states with limited recognition not found in ISO"
"3166-1. Also given in a percentage is each country's population compared with the world population,"
"which the United Nations estimates at 8.07 billion as of 2023.[1]"

"Method"
"Figures used in this chart are based on the most up-to-date estimates or projections by the national census"
"authority, where available, and are usually rounded off."
""
"Where updated national data are not available, figures are based on the estimates or projections for 2022 by"
"the Population Division of the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs."
""
"Because the compiled figures are not collected at the same time in every country, or at the same level of"
"accuracy, the resulting numerical comparisons may create misleading conclusions. Furthermore, the"
"addition of figures from all countries may not equal the world total."
""
"Areas that form integral parts of sovereign states, such as the countries of the United Kingdom, are counted"
"as part of the sovereign states concerned. Not included are other entities that are not sovereign states, such"
"as the European Union,[a] and independent territories that do not have permanent populations, such as the"
"Chagos Archipelago and various countries' claims to Antarctica.[2]"

"Sovereign states and dependencies by population"
"Note: A numbered rank is assigned to the 193 member states of the United Nations, plus the two observer"

"of sovereign states are not assigned a numbered rank. In addition, sovereign states with limited recognition"
"are included, but not assigned a number rank."
